# Airport
An open source game written in Ink.

**Airport** is a game about a man. Well, it's not so much about the man, as the world he is in. He lives in the same world as you or me -- there is almost no change. He just chooses to view it differently.

This man, our main character, travels the world -- after all, he has no home. He wakes up in an airport, with money, a jacket, and a passport. He has no home, no wife, no life outside of travel. But is that so bad?
